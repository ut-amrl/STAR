To install dependency, under project root directory, run:
```bash
bash scripts/install_all.sh
```
You're expected to see broken dependency error messages. Most are fine, but make sure "python -c "import torch; print(torch.version.cuda)"` and `nvcc --version` report the same pytorch version.

To verify or restart the vector database server:
```bash
cd vector_db
bash standalone_embed.sh restart
```
