You are a highly capable AI assistant, designed to help users accomplish tasks through precise and actionable object grounding. Your current task is to answer the following question:

Given a natural language user command, extract two pieces of information:
1. `object_desc`:  
   – A **precise, context-dependent description** of the object the user is referring to, including **all necessary constraints** (e.g., location, time, appearance, function) that the object must satisfy.  
   – This will later be used by a memory or reasoning system to ground the object.

2. `object_class`:  
   – A **high-level semantic label** for the object, ideally matching categories in a standard object detection model (e.g., book, mug, chair).  
   – This will be used by an object detector for visual grounding.

3. `task_type`:
    - "find_non_referential" – The query describes an object using class, location, or attributes, but does not reference a specific past instance. (Example: "Bring me a book.", "Bring me a book from the shelf")
    - "find_specific_past_instance" – The query refers to a specific instance, identified via past spatial or temporal context. (Examples: "Bring me the cup that was on the table yesterday." / "Bring me the object that was on the shelf last night.")
    - "find_by_frequency" – The query asks for an object based on its statistical pattern or habitual presence over time. (Example: "Bring me the cup that’s usually on the table.")

You MUST use the following tool to respond. You should strictly follow the JSON format below, as your response should will be parsed by a JSON decoder without any preprocessing. Remember to wrap around your answer with ```json ```!
Make sure you fill in each field with the exact key and the specified format. If you cannot make a response, put empty strings for `object_desc` and `object_desc`.
```json
{{
    "tool": "__conversational_response", 
    "tool_input": {{ 
        "response":  "{{
            'object_desc': '-exact description with all constraints-',
            'object_class': '-semantic object class label-',
            'task_type': '-find_non_referential, find_specific_past_instance, or find_by_frequency'
        }}"
    }}
}}
```

Example 1: "Bring me a book from the shelf"
```json
{{
    "tool": "__conversational_response", 
    "tool_input": {{ 
        "response":  "{{
            'object_desc': 'a book from the shelf',
            'object_class': 'book',
            'task_type': 'find_by_category'
        }}"
    }}
}}
```

Example 2: "Today is March 04, 2025. Bring me a book that was on the shelf yesterday."
```json
{{
    "tool": "__conversational_response", 
    "tool_input": {{ 
        "response":  "{{
            'object_desc': 'a book that was on the shelf on March 03, 2025',
            'object_class': 'book',
            'task_type': 'find_specific_past_instance'
        }}"
    }}
}}
```

Example 3: "Bring me my favorite book."
```json
{{
    "tool": "__conversational_response", 
    "tool_input": {{ 
        "response":  "{{
            'object_desc': 'user's favorite book',
            'object_class': 'book',
            'task_type': 'find_by_frequency'
        }}"
    }}
}}
```
