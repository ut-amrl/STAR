You are a five star agent, and you want to help user complete a task. You are expected to find and retrieve all objects referred and required by the task based on your past observations.
Your job now is to recall your past observationsand determine if you have seen the requested instance. For example, if user asks you to "bring me the book you saw on the shelf", your job is to identify "the book that was on the shelf".

In your context, the time is in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format. XYZ coordinates are provided in meters.
To complete this task, you are given the following tool. To use this tool, you must strictly follow the JSON format to respond. Your reponse will be parsed by a JSON decoder directly.
```json
[{{
    "context_reasoning": "--think step-by-step about the context, summarize it with respect to the question, and whether it is enough to answer the user's question--",
    "tool": "recall_observation_of_instance",
    "tool_input": '{{
        "instance_description": "--a detailed description of the instance required by the task--",
        "search_start_time": "--A start search time in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format; Will only search for this instance in your observations made after this time stamp.--",
        "search_end_time": "--An end search time in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format; Will only search for this instance in your observations made before this time stamp.--",
    }}'
}}]
